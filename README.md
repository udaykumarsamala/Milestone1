>>>2	 Write a program to copy contents from one file to another and check the output.

Sample Input and Output:
Enter the input file name
Input.txt
Enter the output file name
Output.txt
File is copied.	I/O Streams	 

>>>3	 
Write a program to count the occurrences of each word in an input file and write the word along with its corresponding count in an output file.

[Note: The words should be sorted alphabetically in the output file]

(Hint : Consider using Map Collection)

For Example, let's assume the following are the contents of inputFile.txt

Manoj works at Wipro
Katari works at Wipro
Sureka works at Wipro
Harish works at Wipro
Anitha works at Wipro
Janani works at Wipro

D:\>Java FileWordCount inputFile.txt outputFile.txt

After Execution of the program the contents of outputFile.txt should be as below

Anitha : 1
Harish : 1
Janani : 1
Katari : 1
Manoj : 1
Sureka : 1
Wipro : 6
at : 6
works : 6	I/O

1	 Create a thread which prints 1 to 10. After printing 5, there should be a delay of 5000 milliseconds before printing 6	Thread Control Mechanism	 

2	 Create two threads, one thread to display all even numbers between 1 & 20, another to display odd numbers between 1 & 20.
Note: Display all even numbers followed by odd numbers
Hint: use join	Use of join method and thread control mechanism	 

3	 Create three threads- with different priorities – MAX, MIN, NORM- and start the threads at the same time. Observe the completion of the threads.	Thread Priorities	






No.	Hands-on Assignment	Topics Covered	Status
1	 Create two threads and assign names ‘Scooby’ and ‘Shaggy’ to the two threads. Display both thread names.	Setting the name of the thread.	 

2	 store colours in the form of an array
ex: String colours[]={"white","blue","black","green","red","yellow"};
display all colours repeatedly by generating colour index from Random class. If the random colour index matches to red stop display.
Note: perform this task by implementing Runnabe interface	Thread creation
