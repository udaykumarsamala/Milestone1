A simple paragraph is comprised of three major components. The first sentence, which is often a declarative sentence, is called the â€œtopic sentence.â€? It introduces the topic of the paragraph, setting its tone and mood. The next few sentences elaborate, explain, and exemplify the topic introduced in it.
